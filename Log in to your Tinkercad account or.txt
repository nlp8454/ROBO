Log in to your Tinkercad account or create a new one if you haven't already.

Once logged in, click on the "Create New Design" button to start a new project.

In the Components panel on the right side of the screen, search for and add the following components to your design:

Arduino UNO board
Ultrasonic distance sensor
Piezo buzzer
Connect the components together according to the circuit diagram provided:
Connect the trigger pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 2 of the Arduino.
Connect the echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 3 of the Arduino.
Connect the positive terminal of the piezo buzzer to digital pin 10 of the Arduino
connect the minus to digital gnd
connect the vcc to 5v
connect the gnd to gnd

Replace the existing code in the Arduino coding area with the provided code.

Review the code and make sure it matches the code you have received.

Click on the "Start Simulation" button to run the code and simulate the circuit.

Observe the simulation:

Check the serial monitor in the Tinkercad interface to see the output from the Arduino.
The serial monitor will display whether the door is open or closed and the measured distance.
By following these steps, you will be able to perform the practical on Tinkercad and test the Python code for the sensor using the simulated circuit.
